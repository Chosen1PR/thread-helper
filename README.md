## Features

Do you have referral megathreads in your community for certain products or services? Do you often find a lot of rule-breaking comments in those threads? This app can help! It allows you to:

- Limit users to one comment per referral thread.
- Disable comment replies so that only top-level comments are allowed.
- Disable images and reaction gifs in comments, but only for referral threads.
- Require a minimum post karma, comment karma, and/or combined karma to comment in referral threads.
- Define a list of acceptable link domains for referral links. Comments inside the thread that don't contain a link from one of these domains will be removed.
- Remove comments from outside the thread that contain a referral link.
- Define regexes that comments must have or must not have.
- Configure whether or not to message users privately from the bot account (not modmail) when their comment is removed and explain why.

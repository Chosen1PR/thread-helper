## Features

Do you have referral megathreads in your community for certain products or services? Do you often find a lot of rule-breaking comments in those threads? This app can help! It allows you to:

- Limit users to one comment per referral thread.
- Disable comment replies so that only top-level comments are allowed.
- Disable images and reaction gifs in comments only in referral threads.
- Require a minimum post karma, comment karma, and/or combined karma to comment in referral threads. These user requirements are hidden and never publicly exposed.
- Allow only flaired users to comment in referral threads, and optionally define a list of required flair CSS classes.
- Define a list of acceptable link domains for referral links.
- Require links in thread comments.
- Remove comments from outside the thread that contain a referral link.
- Define regexes that comments must have or must not match.
- Optionally message users privately from the bot account (not modmail) when their comment is removed and explain why.
- Remove posts that contain referral links.
- Optionally comment on posts that contain referral links.

For slightly more comment removal versatility, feel free to also check out my other app [Diverse Comments](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/diverse-comments)!
